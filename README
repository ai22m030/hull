# APRG_ConvexHull

## General operation

The programm has 2 modes:
- mode 0: The speed mode
  calculates the convex hull using the Jarvis' March algorithm and prints out a list of all points located on the boundaries of the hull
- mode 1: The graphics mode
  shows an graphical animation of how the algorithm determines the points which form the convex hull

In both modes you can define for how many points a hull shall be determined. The points are then derived at random.

## Libraries used
